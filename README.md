# TASK-2
[Website Link](https://charan-04.github.io/iotAlliance_Registration_Form/)<br />
I have made a simple a simple Registration form using HTML,CSS,JS. <br/><br/>
**THE DESIGN** <br />
I love splitting screens as left side and right side in projects hence i have again split the project into 2 partsðŸ˜…<br/>
The left-container has only a image.<br/>
The right-container contains the registration form with fields username, email, phone number, password, confirm password inputs and a submit button in it.<br/>
I have also created a very basic redirected page if the form get successfully submitted.<br/><br/><img width="1439" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-07 at 5 30 38 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77110886/136393393-d280c4e4-385e-453d-abc9-40e3205791da.png">

**The HTML** </br>
I havenâ€™t used any Framework for this Task.<br/>
I have added font-awesome CDN in the head tag,style css and script tag at the end of body tag to connect the JS file.<br/><br/>
**The CSS** <br/>
Here i have added all the colours to the text,background, padding and other basic properties of CSS. A media query is add till max-width of 998px which changes some property values to make the website responsive for smaller screens.<br/><br/>
**The JS** <br/>
Instead of the ugly alert dialog box when someone doesnâ€™t enter some field is used setErrorMsg in JS to make the error look nice and user friendly.<br/><br/>
Once the registration is done alert is displayed saying Registration successful and then redirecting to our other page(demo.html)
